# 1. Basic - Print all integers from 0 to 150.
for x in range(0, 150, 1)
for x in range(150)

# 2. Multiples of Five - Print all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000
for x in range(0, 1000, 5)

# 3. Counting, the Dojo Way - Print integers 1 to 100. If divisible by 5, print "Coding" instead. If divisible by 10, print "Coding Dojo".
for x in range(1, 100, 1)
  if val 'divided by' 5 
  print('Coding')

# 4. Whoa. That Sucker's Huge - Add odd integers from 0 to 500,000, and print the final sum.


# 5. Countdown by Fours - Print positive numbers starting at 2018, counting down by fours.


# 6. Flexible Counter - Set three variables: lowNum, highNum, mult. Starting at lowNum and going through highNum, print only the integers that are a multiple of mult. For example, if lowNum=2, highNum=9, and mult=3, the loop should print 3, 6, 9 (on successive lines
